        <p>Kare Kare is a traditional Filipino stew complimented with a thick savory peanut sauce. The commonly used meats for 
            this dish are ox tail, tripe, and pork leg; on some occasions goat and chicken meat are also used. Besides the peanuts, 
            this dish depends on the shrimp paste (on the side) in order to be fully enjoyed. Traditionally, “palayok” (clay cooking 
            pot) is used to cook this dish and it is also used as the serving pot.</p>
